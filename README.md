# The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router)
## *by Colt Steele*

I am taking this course to further my knowledge with React
Previsouly, I completed a shorter React course by Angela Yu, which was a great intro and was solely based on Functional components.
This course is more in-depth and also includes Class components, which some code bases still rely on.

## Summary of topics this course will cover:

- React Hooks! (My favorite part of React!)
- The new Context API
- State management w/ useReducer + use Context (Redux Lite)
- The basics of React (props, state, etc)
